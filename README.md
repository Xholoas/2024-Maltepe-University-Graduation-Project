As my graduation project, I developed an application that predicts the prices of shares on the S&P500 stock exchange 
'n' months later using LSTM and Linear models.

This application predicts future stock prices using LSTM and Linear models. Users can choose stocks, view historical and future price predictions, and compare model performance via MSE, MAE, and RMSE metrics. An intuitive interface allows easy stock selection, random stock options, and visualization of real and predicted data, providing an accessible and insightful user experience.
